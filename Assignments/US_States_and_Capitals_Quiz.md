## Assignment: Python Lists and Dictionaries
## U.S. States and Capitals Quiz Program

**Total Points:** 25  

---

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will demonstrate your ability to:
- Create and manipulate Python dictionaries effectively
- Use the `random` module for data selection
- Implement user input validation and interaction
- Apply string methods for text processing
- Write clean, well-commented Python code with proper control structures

---

## üìã Assignment Overview

You will create an interactive quiz program that tests users' knowledge of U.S. state capitals. The program will use dictionaries to store state-capital pairs, randomly select questions, track user performance, and provide feedback on quiz results.

---

## üìö Part 1: Data Structure Setup (8 points)

### Step 1: Create the States Dictionary (5 points)

Create a dictionary called `states_capitals` containing all 50 U.S. states as keys and their capitals as values. 

**Reference:** [Britannica - U.S. State Capitals](https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-state-capitals-in-the-United-States-2119210)

Your dictionary should follow this format:
```python
states_capitals = {
    "Alabama": "Montgomery",
    "Alaska": "Juneau",
    "Arizona": "Phoenix",
    # ... continue for all 50 states
}
```

### Step 2: Data Validation (3 points)

Write code to:
- Print the total number of states in your dictionary
- Print the first 5 states and capitals (alphabetically) to verify your data
- Check that you have exactly 50 state-capital pairs

---

## üéÆ Part 2: Quiz Implementation (12 points)

### Step 1: Random Question Selection (4 points)
- Import the `random` module
- Create a function or code block that randomly selects 5 states from your dictionary
- Ensure no state is repeated in a single quiz session

### Step 2: User Interaction Loop (5 points)
Create a quiz loop that:
- Displays each question in the format: "What is the capital of [State Name]?"
- Accepts user input for each answer
- Handles case-insensitive matching (e.g., "austin" should match "Austin")
- Provides immediate feedback after each question ("Correct!" or "Incorrect. The correct answer is [Capital]")

### Step 3: Score Tracking (3 points)
- Keep track of correct and incorrect responses
- Display the running question number (e.g., "[1]", "[2]", etc.)
- Calculate and display the final score in the format: "Your score is X out of 5"

---

## ‚ú® Part 3: Program Enhancement (5 points)

### Step 1: Input Validation (2 points)
- Handle empty responses (prompt user to enter an answer)
- Strip whitespace from user inputs
- Handle basic spelling variations where reasonable

### Step 2: Enhanced User Experience (3 points)
- Display a welcome message explaining the quiz
- Show progress during the quiz (question X of 5)
- Provide encouraging feedback based on final score:
  - **5/5:** "Perfect! Excellent knowledge of U.S. geography!"
  - **4/5:** "Great job! You know your state capitals well!"
  - **3/5:** "Good work! You got more than half correct!"
  - **1-2/5:** "Keep studying! You'll improve with practice!"
  - **0/5:** "Don't give up! Review the state capitals and try again!"

## üîß Implementation Strategy

Follow this recommended approach:

1. **Create the complete dictionary** with all 50 states and capitals
2. **Test your data structure** by printing a few entries
3. **Implement random selection** of 5 states for the quiz
4. **Build the quiz loop** with user input and scoring
5. **Add input validation** and user experience enhancements
6. **Test thoroughly** with different inputs and edge cases

## üí° Tips for Success

### üêç Programming Tips
1. **Start with a small dictionary** (5-10 states) for initial testing
2. **Test random selection** multiple times to ensure it works correctly
3. **Handle case sensitivity** using `.lower()` or `.upper()` methods
4. **Use `random.choice()` or `random.sample()`** for selecting states
5. **Print intermediate values** while debugging your logic

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Forgetting to import the `random` module
- Not handling case sensitivity in user inputs
- Allowing duplicate questions in the same quiz
- Incorrect final score calculation
- Missing input validation for empty responses

### üìì Jupyter Notebook Tips
- Use markdown cells to document your approach
- Test your code in small chunks before combining
- Include sample outputs in your notebook
- Make sure all cells run successfully from top to bottom

## üöÄ Extension Ideas (Optional)

If you finish early, consider these enhancements:
- Add a difficulty level system (easy/medium/hard based on population or region)
- Include multiple choice options instead of free-text input
- Add a timer for each question
- Create a leaderboard system
- Allow users to choose the number of questions

---

## üìû Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Review the implementation strategy section
2. Check the common pitfalls list
3. Test your code incrementally
4. Use print statements to debug logic
5. Ask questions during office hours
