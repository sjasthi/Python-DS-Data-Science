# Assignment
## Python Data Structures (Python DS)
---

## **Assignment Overview**

This assignment focuses on creating and implementing Python classes with proper object-oriented programming principles. You will design a custom class, implement essential methods, and use AI tools for code review to improve your programming skills.

### **Learning Objectives**
By completing this assignment, students will be able to:
- [ ] Design and implement a Python class with appropriate attributes
- [ ] Write constructor (`__init__`), string representation (`__str__`), and detailed representation (`__repr__`) methods
- [ ] Create comprehensive test cases for class functionality
- [ ] Use AI tools effectively for code review and skill improvement

## **Assignment Parts**

### **Part A: Write a Python Class** *(Points: 70/100)*

**Instructions:**
1. **Choose Your Class Name:** Pick a class that starts with the **first letter of your last name**
   - Example: If your last name starts with "T", you could choose "Table", "Tree", "Truck", etc.

2. **Identify Two Attributes:** Select two meaningful properties for your class
   - Example: For a "Table" class, you might choose "color" and "cost"

3. **Implement Required Methods:**
   - `__init__` method (constructor)
   - `__str__` method (user-friendly string representation)
   - `__repr__` method (developer-friendly representation)

4. **Write Testing Code:** Include comprehensive test cases that demonstrate your class works correctly

**Requirements:**
- [ ] Class name starts with first letter of your last name
- [ ] Two meaningful attributes defined
- [ ] `__init__` method properly initializes attributes
- [ ] `__str__` method returns user-friendly output
- [ ] `__repr__` method returns detailed/technical output
- [ ] Testing code demonstrates all methods work
- [ ] Code runs without errors and produces output
- [ ] Code includes appropriate comments

**Reference Material:**
- GitHub Repository: https://github.com/sjasthi/python101/blob/main/ch10_concepts_objects_and_classes.ipynb
- See examples of how other students have implemented different classes

**Code Structure Example:**
```python
class YourClassName:
    def __init__(self, attribute1, attribute2):
        # Initialize your attributes
        pass
    
    def __str__(self):
        # Return user-friendly string
        pass
    
    def __repr__(self):
        # Return technical representation
        pass

# Testing code
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create instances and test your class
    pass
```

**Grading Criteria for Part A:**
- [ ] Correct class implementation (25 points)
- [ ] All required methods implemented correctly (25 points)
- [ ] Comprehensive testing code (15 points)
- [ ] Code quality, comments, and style (5 points)

### **Part B: Use Claude.ai as Code Reviewer** *(Points: 30/100)*

**Instructions:**
1. **Complete Part A First:** Finish writing your Python class entirely on your own
   - **Important:** Try doing Part A without using Claude.ai initially

2. **Submit to Claude.ai for Review:**
   - Go to claude.ai
   - Attach the Python file you created
   - Use this exact prompt: 
     > "Here is python class I wrote! Can you review this code? How can I improve my coding skills?"

3. **Document the Response:** Save Claude.ai's complete response about your code review and skill improvement suggestions

**Grading Criteria for Part B:**
- [ ] Evidence of code review request to Claude.ai (10 points)
- [ ] Complete Claude.ai response documented (10 points)
- [ ] Response shows meaningful feedback on code improvement (10 points)

## **Submission Requirements**

### **What to Submit:**
1. **Python Class File (.ipynb)** - Your complete implementation from Part A
2. **Claude.ai Response Document** - Text file or PDF containing the complete feedback from Claude.ai

### **File Naming Convention:**
- Python file: `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2_PartA.py`
- Review document: `LastName_FirstName_Assignment2_PartB.txt` (or .pdf)

### **Submission Checklist:**
- [ ] Python code runs without errors
- [ ] All required methods implemented
- [ ] Testing code included and produces output
- [ ] Claude.ai review completed and documented
- [ ] Files named correctly
- [ ] Both files submitted before deadline
