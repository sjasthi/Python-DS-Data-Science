## üí° Helpful Hints

### Getting Started:
- Begin by exploring the data with `df.head()` and `df.info()`
- Use `df.columns.tolist()` to see all column names clearly
- Remember that `.describe()` only shows numerical columns by default

### Common Methods You'll Need:
- **Data Inspection:** `.head()`, `.tail()`, `.info()`, `.shape`, `.dtypes`
- **Missing Data:** `.isnull()`, `.isna()`, `.sum()`, `.any()`
- **Statistics:** `.describe()`, `.mean()`, `.median()`, `.std()`, `.min()`, `.max()`
- **Counting:** `.value_counts()`, `.nunique()`, `len()`
- **Sorting:** `.sort_values()`, `.nlargest()`, `.nsmallest()`

### Google Colab Tips:
- Use `Ctrl+Enter` to run the current cell
- Use `Shift+Enter` to run current cell and move to next
- Add markdown cells to document your findings
- Use `print()` statements to clearly label your outputs

## üîç Expected Insights

While working through this assignment, you should discover insights such as:
- Which demographic groups tend to perform better academically
- The relationship between parental education level and student performance
- How test preparation courses affect student scores
- Whether there are performance differences across different subjects

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Don't assume the data is clean - always check for missing values and inconsistencies
- Remember that `.describe()` only shows numerical columns by default
- Be careful with data types - some columns that look numerical might be stored as text
- Don't forget to label your outputs clearly so they're easy to understand
- Make sure to actually answer the questions posed in each task
