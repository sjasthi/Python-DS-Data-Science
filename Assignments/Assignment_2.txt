This is programming exercise 2 from the text book Chapter 9: Dictionaries and Sets
(page Number: 518; PDF page number: 534) 
Capital Quiz 

Write a program that creates a dictionary containing the U.S. states as keys, and their capitals as values. 
(Use the Internet to get a list of the states and their capitals.) The program
should then randomly quiz the user by displaying the name of a state and asking the user
to enter that stateâ€™s capital. The program should keep a count of the number of correct and
incorrect responses. (As an alternative to the U.S. states, the program can use the names of
countries and their capitals.)


================  Implementation Strategy =========================================

[1] Maintain a dictionary of all 50 states (state is the KEY) and their capitals (Capital is the VALUE)
You can get the list from  https://www.britannica.com/topic/list-of-state-capitals-in-the-United-States-2119210

[2] Assume that you are asking 5 random questions to the user.


[1] What is the capital of Minnesota?
St.Paul

[2] What is the capital of Texax?
Dallas


[3] What is the capital of Florida?
Disneyland

[4] What is the capital of California?
San Franscisco


[5] What is the Massachuets?
Boston


Result: Your score is 3 out of 5.

========= What to submit? ==========================
1. Submit the completed "python_ds_assignment_2.ipynb"
2. Capture two runs (run the program two times) and capture the output in a text file.
Submit the text file also to the assignment folder.
