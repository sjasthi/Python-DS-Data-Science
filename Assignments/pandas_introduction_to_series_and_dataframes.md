## üìä Part 1: Working with Pandas Series (8 points)

### Task 1.1: Creating Series Objects (3 points)

**Your Challenge:** Create three different Series objects using the data provided below. For each Series, you must determine the appropriate method to create it and then analyze its properties.

**Data to work with:**
- **Temperature data:** `[68, 72, 75, 71, 69, 73, 76, 78, 74, 70]` (daily temperatures in Fahrenheit)
- **Student grades:** Alice: 92, Bob: 87, Charlie: 94, Diana: 89, Eve: 91
- **Daily steps:** Monday: 8500, Tuesday: 7200, Wednesday: 9100, Thursday: 6800, Friday: 7500, Saturday: 12000, Sunday: 11500

**What you need to do:**
1. Create a Series for temperature data with the name 'Temperature_F'
2. Create a Series for student grades using appropriate index labels
3. Create a Series for daily steps with day names as the index

**Questions to answer for each Series:**
- What is the shape of the Series?
- What is the data type?
- What type of index does it have?
- Print the first 3 values

```python
# Your code here for creating the three Series

# Temperature Series


# Student grades Series


# Daily steps Series


# Answer the questions for each Series

```

### Task 1.2: Series Operations (3 points)

**Your Challenge:** Using the Series you created above, perform the following operations:

1. **Temperature Analysis:**
   - Calculate mean, median, minimum, and maximum temperature
   - Convert the entire temperature Series from Fahrenheit to Celsius using the formula: C = (F - 32) √ó 5/9
   - Find how many days had temperature above the average

2. **Student Performance:**
   - Find students who scored above 90
   - Calculate the class average
   - Determine who scored the highest and lowest

3. **Activity Tracking:**
   - Find the day with maximum steps
   - Calculate average daily steps
   - Identify weekend vs weekday average steps

```python
# Your code here - Temperature Analysis


# Your code here - Student Performance Analysis


# Your code here - Activity Analysis

```

### Task 1.3: Series Indexing Practice (2 points)

**Your Challenge:** Practice different indexing methods on your Series:

1. Use **label-based indexing (.loc[])** to:
   - Get Wednesday's step count
   - Get Alice's and Charlie's grades
   - Get temperatures for positions 2, 4, and 6

2. Use **position-based indexing (.iloc[])** to:
   - Get the first 3 temperatures
   - Get the last 2 grades
   - Get every other step count (positions 0, 2, 4, 6)

3. Use **boolean indexing** to:
   - Find days with steps > 8000
   - Find students with grades between 88 and 93
   - Find temperatures below 70¬∞F

```python
# Your indexing code here
# Label-based indexing (.loc[])


# Position-based indexing (.iloc[])


# Boolean indexing

```

## üìã Part 2: Creating and Exploring DataFrames (10 points)

### Task 2.1: DataFrame Creation Challenge (4 points)

**Your Challenge:** Create THREE DataFrames using different methods:

**DataFrame 1: Employee Records** (Create from dictionary)
```
employee_id: 101, 102, 103, 104, 105
name: 'John Smith', 'Jane Doe', 'Bob Johnson', 'Alice Williams', 'Charlie Brown'
department: 'IT', 'HR', 'Finance', 'IT', 'Marketing'
salary: 75000, 68000, 72000, 80000, 65000
years_experience: 5, 3, 7, 6, 2
```

**DataFrame 2: Product Inventory** (Create from list of dictionaries)
```
Products: 
- Laptop: Electronics, $999.99, stock: 25
- Mouse: Electronics, $29.99, stock: 150  
- Desk Chair: Furniture, $199.99, stock: 45
- Monitor: Electronics, $299.99, stock: 30
- Keyboard: Electronics, $79.99, stock: 80
```

**DataFrame 3: Sales Matrix** (Create from NumPy array)
```
6 months (Jan-Jun) √ó 4 regions (North, South, East, West)
Use: np.random.seed(42) then create random integers between 100-1000
```

**Requirements:**
- Use the correct DataFrame creation method for each
- Set appropriate index and column names where needed
- Display the shape and basic info for each DataFrame

```python
# DataFrame 1: Employee Records (from dictionary)


# DataFrame 2: Product Inventory (from list of dictionaries)


# DataFrame 3: Sales Matrix (from NumPy array)
np.random.seed(42)  # Use this for reproducible results


# Display basic information for each DataFrame

```

### Task 2.2: DataFrame Exploration (3 points)

**Your Challenge:** For each DataFrame you created, perform comprehensive exploration:

**For Employee DataFrame:**
- Use `.info()` and `.describe()` 
- Count employees by department
- Check for any missing values
- List all unique departments

**For Product DataFrame:**
- Show descriptive statistics for price and stock
- Count products by category  
- Find the most expensive and cheapest products

**For Sales DataFrame:**
- Display first 3 and last 3 rows
- Show column names and index
- Calculate basic statistics

```python
# Employee DataFrame exploration


# Product DataFrame exploration


# Sales DataFrame exploration

```

### Task 2.3: DataFrame Selection and Filtering (3 points)

**Your Challenge:** Practice selecting data from your DataFrames:

1. **Column Selection:**
   - Select just employee names and salaries
   - Select product names and prices
   - Select sales data for just 'North' and 'South' regions

2. **Row Selection:**  
   - Select employees with ID 102 and 104
   - Select the first 2 products
   - Select sales data for March and April

3. **Conditional Selection:**
   - Find employees with salary > $70,000
   - Find products with stock < 50
   - Find months where North region sales > 500

```python
# Column selection exercises


# Row selection exercises


# Conditional selection exercises

```

## üí° Helpful Hints

### Getting Started Tips:
- Review the class notebook examples before coding
- Start with simple cases and build complexity
- Test each piece of code before moving to the next task

### Common Student Mistakes to Avoid:
- Forgetting that single column selection returns a Series, not DataFrame
- Confusing .loc[] (label-based) with .iloc[] (position-based) indexing  
- Not using parentheses for multiple conditions in boolean indexing
- Trying to modify DataFrames without assigning the result back

### When You're Stuck:
1. Check the pandas documentation
2. Print intermediate results to understand what you have
3. Break complex operations into smaller steps
4. Review similar examples from the class notebook

### Google Colab Tips:
- Use Ctrl+Enter to run current cell
- Use Shift+Enter to run cell and move to next
- Use Ctrl+M, A to add cell above
- Use Ctrl+M, B to add cell below
