# Assignment: Understanding Basic Data Visualizations
**Course:** Python for Data Science  
**Type:** Research & Presentation (Non-Programming)  
**Total Points:** 25

## 🎯 Objective

Data visualization is one of the most powerful tools in a data scientist's toolkit. Before writing a single line of code, you need to **understand what each chart type means, when to use it, and what story it tells**.

In this assignment, you will research **6 fundamental plot types** used in Python's pandas library and present your findings as a slide deck.

---

## 📋 Assignment Overview

Create an **8-slide presentation** (PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva) covering the six plot types listed below. Your presentation should demonstrate that you understand not just *how* to make a chart, but *why* and *when* to use it.

### The Six Plot Types

```python
Line Plot
Bar Plot
Histogram
Box Plot
Area Plot
Scatter Plot
```

## 📐 Slide Structure (8 Slides Total)

### Slide 1 — Title Slide
- Your name and course
- Assignment title: *"Exploring Data Visualizations in Python"*
- Date

---

### Slides 2–7 — One Slide Per Plot Type

Each slide must cover **all five of the following elements** for its assigned plot:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **What is it?** | A plain-English definition of the plot |
| **What does it represent?** | What kind of data or relationship does it show? |
| **When to use it?** | Conditions or scenarios where this plot is the right choice |
| **Real-world use case** | A concrete example (e.g., "track a stock price over 12 months") |
| **When NOT to use it** | At least one scenario where this chart would be misleading or inappropriate |

Include at least **one example image** of the plot on each slide (find one online or sketch it).

**Plot assignments by slide:**

| Slide | Plot Type |
|-------|-----------|
| Slide 2 | Line Plot |
| Slide 3 | Bar Plot |
| Slide 4 | Histogram |
| Slide 5 | Box Plot |
| Slide 6 | Area Plot |
| Slide 7 | Scatter Plot |

---

### Slide 8 — Conclusion Slide

Answer the following two questions **in your own words**:

1. If you were given a dataset of monthly sales figures for 3 different products over 2 years, which **two** plots from this assignment would you use and why?
2. Which plot type was the **most surprising or new** to you, and what did you learn about it?

## 📊 Grading Rubric

| Component | Criteria | Points |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| **Title Slide** | Complete with name, course, and date | 1 |
| **6 Plot Slides** | All 5 elements covered for each plot (3 pts × 6 slides) | 18 |
| **Example Images** | At least one relevant image per plot slide | 3 |
| **Conclusion Slide** | Both questions answered thoughtfully in own words | 2 |
| **Presentation Quality** | Clear, organized layout; readable fonts and colors | 1 |
| **Total** | | **25** |

> **Per-slide breakdown (3 pts each):**  
> 1 pt — What it is + what it represents  
> 1 pt — When to use it + real-world use case  
> 1 pt — When NOT to use it

## 💡 Tips for Success

- **Use your own words.** Do not copy-paste definitions from the internet.
- **Be specific with use cases.** "It shows data" is too vague. "It compares monthly revenue across 5 product categories" is specific.
- **Think about the audience.** Would a business manager understand your slide without any Python knowledge?
- **Keep each slide focused.** Bullet points are better than long paragraphs in a presentation.
