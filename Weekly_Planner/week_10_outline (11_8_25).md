## 💡 Tips for Success

**Before You Start:**
- Make sure you have NumPy installed (`pip install numpy`)
- Review Python basics (lists, loops, functions)
- Set aside dedicated time to work through materials

**While Learning:**
- Don't just read—type and run the code yourself
- Experiment with examples by changing values
- Take notes on concepts that confuse you
- Ask questions in the discussion board

**For the Assignment:**
- Complete the interactive challenges first
- Use the interactive tool to understand concepts
- Test each challenge in your notebook individually
- Add comments to explain your code
- Restart kernel and run all cells before submitting
