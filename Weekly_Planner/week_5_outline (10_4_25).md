# Week 5 Outline - Data Encapsulation & Python Libraries
**Date:** October 4, 2025

---

## In-Class Activities

### 1. Review Google Colab Notebook
We will review and work through the following notebook:

**Topic:** Data Encapsulation & Exploring Python Libraries

**Notebook Link:**
https://github.com/sjasthi/Python-DS-Data-Science/blob/main/python_ds_data_encapsulation_and_exploring_libraries.ipynb

**What we'll cover:**
- Understanding data encapsulation concepts
- How to import Python libraries
- Using `dir()` to explore library contents
- Using `help()` to understand functions
- Using `type()` to check data types
- Working with common Python libraries

---

## Hands-On Practice

### 2. Complete the Coding Cells
During class (and as practice), you should:
- Work through all the example cells in the notebook
- Complete the "TRY IT YOURSELF" sections
- Experiment with the code to deepen understanding
- Ask questions if you get stuck

**Remember:** The best way to learn programming is by writing code yourself!

## Assignment Due This Week

### Assignment 4: Exploring the Requests Module
**Due:** End of Week 5  
**Points:** 25 points

**Assignment Notebook:**
https://github.com/sjasthi/Python-DS-Data-Science/blob/main/Assignments/python_ds_exploring_requests_module_assignment.ipynb

**What you'll do:**
- Install and import the `requests` module
- Make HTTP GET requests to websites and APIs
- Explore the Response object using `dir()` and `help()`
- Work with different response types (JSON, text, headers)
- Extract data from web APIs
- Complete a final challenge project

**Submission Requirements:**
- Complete all TODO sections in the notebook
- Ensure all code cells run without errors
- Answer all reflection questions
- Save and submit your completed notebook

1. Understand what data encapsulation means in Python
2. Import and use Python libraries effectively
3. Explore unfamiliar libraries using built-in Python tools
4. Make web requests using the `requests` module
5. Parse and work with API responses
6. Use `dir()`, `help()`, and `type()` to understand code

## Tips for Success

1. **Start the assignment early** - Don't wait until the last minute
2. **Run code frequently** - Test as you go, don't write everything at once
3. **Read error messages carefully** - They tell you what's wrong
4. **Use the exploration tools** - `dir()`, `help()`, and `type()` are your friends
5. **Ask for help** - If you're stuck for more than 15 minutes, reach out
