## üìñ Week 8 Focus Areas

This week, concentrate on mastering these advanced topics that are critical for Assignment 6:

### üéØ Priority 1: Multi-Criteria Functions
**Functions to Master:**
- `COUNTIFS()` - Count with multiple conditions
- `AVERAGEIF()` / `AVERAGEIFS()` - Conditional averages
- `SUMIFS()` - Conditional sums

**Where you'll use them:**
- Part B: Survival rates by passenger class
- Part C: Passengers traveling alone (SibSp=0 AND Parch=0)
- Part C: Complex filtering scenarios

**Practice:** Try creating your own multi-criteria questions and solve them!

---

### üéØ Priority 2: Text Functions
**Functions to Master:**
- `LEFT()`, `RIGHT()`, `MID()` - Extract portions of text
- `FIND()`, `SEARCH()` - Locate text within strings
- `LEN()` - Text length
- Text to Columns feature
- Wildcard matching with `COUNTIF()`

**Where you'll use them:**
- Part A: Identifying tickets with only numbers
- Part C: Extracting last names from full names
- Part C: Counting passengers by title (Mr., Mrs., Miss, Master)

**Practice:** Try extracting different parts of passenger names!

---

### üéØ Priority 3: Data Validation & Quality
**Skills to Master:**
- Handling missing/blank values
- Counting unique values
- Using `COUNTA()` vs `COUNT()`
- `COUNTBLANK()` for missing data

## üí° Week 8 Success Strategies

### Tackling Difficult Questions
**Part C Questions are the most challenging!** Here's how to approach them:

#### Question 24: Most Common Last Name
**Approaches:**
1. **Text to Columns Method:**
   - Copy Name column ‚Üí Data ‚Üí Text to Columns ‚Üí Delimiter: Comma
   - Use COUNTIF on the extracted last names
   - Find the MAX count

2. **Formula Method:**
   - Create helper column: `=LEFT(Name, FIND(",", Name)-1)`
   - Count occurrences and identify most common

3. **Google Sheets Bonus:**
   - Use `UNIQUE()` and `QUERY()` functions for elegant solution

#### Question 25: Counting by Title
**Strategy:**
- Use wildcards: `=COUNTIF(Name_Range, "*Mr.*")`
- The `*` matches any characters before/after "Mr."
- Count each title separately: Mr., Mrs., Miss, Master

**Pro Tip:** Test your formulas on a few rows first to ensure they work correctly!

### Common Week 8 Challenges & Solutions

#### Challenge 1: "My COUNTIFS isn't working!"
**Solutions:**
- Check that all ranges are the same size
- Ensure criteria are properly formatted (numbers vs text)
- Use absolute references ($) where needed
- Verify there are no extra spaces in criteria

#### Challenge 2: "Text functions return errors"
**Solutions:**
- Check for blank cells (use IFERROR wrapper)
- Verify the delimiter exists (e.g., comma in name)
- Test on a single cell first before applying to entire column

#### Challenge 3: "I don't know which function to use"
**Solutions:**
- Read the question carefully - keywords matter!
- "How many" ‚Üí COUNT functions
- "Average" ‚Üí AVERAGE functions
- "Multiple conditions" ‚Üí Use functions ending in "S" (COUNTIFS, SUMIFS)
- "Extract text" ‚Üí LEFT, RIGHT, MID, FIND

#### Challenge 4: "Running out of time!"
**Solutions:**
- Focus on Parts A & B first (easier questions)
- Use Google if stuck - search "Excel [your question]"
- Ask for help in office hours or discussion forum
- Part C is advanced - allocate more time for it
