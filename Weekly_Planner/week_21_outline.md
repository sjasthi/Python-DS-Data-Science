# Week 21 --- Kaggle & The Data Science Community

**Course:** Python for Data Science\
**Topics:** Introduction to Kaggle · Exploring Datasets · Learning from
Notebooks · Beginner Competitions

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this week, students will be able to:

-   Understand what Kaggle is and why it is useful for Data Science
    students
-   Create a Kaggle account and explore datasets
-   Browse and read Kaggle Notebooks (Kernels)
-   Download datasets and use them in Google Colab
-   Understand how beginner competitions work
-   Identify ways to showcase and host their own Data Science projects

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## What is Kaggle?

Kaggle is an online platform for Data Science and Machine Learning where
students can:

-   Explore real-world datasets
-   Learn from other people's notebooks
-   Participate in beginner competitions
-   Join discussions with other learners
-   Be part of a global Data Science community

Think of Kaggle as: "YouTube + GitHub + Science Fair --- for Data
Science!"

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Why Should You Use Kaggle?

-   It provides real-world datasets beyond classroom examples
-   Students can see how professionals solve problems
-   It builds confidence by exploring real AI projects
-   It encourages curiosity and independent learning
-   It allows students to showcase projects publicly

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Big Idea of the Week

Data Science is not just coding.\
It is exploring, asking questions, and learning from others.

This week, students move from: Learning Data Science → Being part of the
Data Science community.
