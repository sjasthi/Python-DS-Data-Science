## üí° Tips for Success

### Excel/Sheets Best Practices
1. **Create a separate "Answers" sheet** to document your responses and formulas
2. **Use cell comments** to explain complex formulas
3. **Don't delete or modify the original data** - work on a copy
4. **Test your formulas** on small samples before applying to entire columns
5. **Use named ranges** to make formulas more readable

### Learning Strategy
- **Watch ‚Üí Practice ‚Üí Apply:** Don't just watch videos passively
- **Follow along:** Open Excel/Sheets while watching tutorials
- **Experiment:** Try variations of formulas to understand how they work
- **Ask questions:** Use office hours or discussion boards if stuck
- **Start early:** Don't wait until the last minute!

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- ‚ùå Not accounting for blank/missing values in calculations
- ‚ùå Using wrong cell references (relative vs absolute)
- ‚ùå Not showing your work (formulas are graded, not just answers!)
- ‚ùå Forgetting to count unique values when the question asks for "unique"

## üÜò Getting Help

### Resources
1. **Office Hours:** Check syllabus for times
2. **Discussion Forum:** Post questions and help classmates
3. **Assignment Instructions:** Both Excel and Google Sheets versions include helpful tips
4. **YouTube Playlist:** Rewatch specific videos as needed

### Troubleshooting
- **Excel not working?** Try Google Sheets instead
- **Formula errors?** Check for typos and proper syntax
- **Confused about a function?** Google "Excel [function name] tutorial"
- **Need more examples?** The video playlist covers most scenarios
