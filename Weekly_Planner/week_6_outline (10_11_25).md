## 📚 Topics Covered Today

### [1] Introduction to Data Science Process
**What is Data Science and how do we approach it?**

📊 [Presentation: What is Data Science - Introduction to Process](https://github.com/sjasthi/Python-DS-Data-Science/blob/main/Presentations/what_is_data_science_introduction_to_process.pptx)

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Understand the Data Science workflow
- Learn the steps from problem to solution
- Identify the iterative nature of DS projects

---

### [2] Where to Get Data? - Data Sources
**Discovering reliable sources for your projects**

🔍 [Guide: Where to Get Data for DS and ML](https://github.com/sjasthi/Python-DS-Data-Science/blob/main/Where_to_get_data_for_DS_and_ML.pdf)

**Key Learning Objectives:**
- Explore public datasets and APIs
- Understand data collection methods
- Learn about data ethics and usage rights

---

### [3] Data Types - Understanding Your Data
**The foundation of data analysis**

📈 [Presentation: Introduction to Data Types](https://github.com/sjasthi/Python-DS-Data-Science/blob/main/Presentations/introduction_to_data_types.pptx)

**Topics Covered:**
- **Quantitative vs Qualitative Data**
  - Quantitative: Numerical measurements
  - Qualitative: Descriptive characteristics

- **Continuous vs Discrete Data**
  - Continuous: Can take any value (decimals allowed)
  - Discrete: Specific values only (usually whole numbers)

- **Measurement Scales (NOIR)**
  - **N**ominal: Categories with no order (colors, types)
  - **O**rdinal: Categories with order (rankings, sizes)
  - **I**nterval: Equal intervals, no true zero (temperature in °C)
  - **R**atio: Equal intervals WITH true zero (height, weight)
